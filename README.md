This project involves designing and implementing a three-floor elevator system powered by an ESP32 microcontroller. The system uses a DC geared motor to move the elevator cage, and floor requests are handled through programmed logic. The aim is to create a reliable and automated elevator system, with the potential for integration into smart-building frameworks.
Technologies used are ESP32 microcontroller for system control, C++ as the primary programming language, components such as L298N motor driver to control the DC geared motor, an ultrasonic sensor for floor detection, OLED for floor display and input buttons.
This is a group project of 5 members where each person was working on a module. I worked on programming the ESP32 for lift cage up and down movement while another person worked on the opening and closing of the doors, another on the buttons and direction selectors and another on emergency stop mechanisms.
Future plans are underway to implement AI-based automation for elevator usage prediction.
